This is the first version for my Drawmon Pokemon clone game! 

I have made a battle and catch sequence using C++ with the intentions of making a pokemon clone. 

I named the game Drawmon because I am going to draw all of the art work for the drawmon and backgrounds myself.

I am planning to use the directx library for the graphics.

This project is a way for me to be creative and work on my C++ skills.

I will update my page with my first draft of the full game as soon as it is ready.

In the meantime, enjoy this demo of my game
